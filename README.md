- 👋 Hi, I’m @tapiwago
- 👀 I’m interested in data structures and **algorithms** as well as cool front end tools. It certainly cheers me up to see the products I build make a diifference in people's lives
- 🌱 I’m currently a **fullstack developer**. My stack includes **React**, **NodeJs**, **Redux**, **Sequalize**, **MySQL**, **AWS services**, **MS AZURE**, **TypeScript**
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any react apps that are aimed at availing information to people in general.
- 📫 You can get hold of me on my email **tapiwago311@gmail.com** or via my mobile  **+263783578904**
